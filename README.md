# Studying Neural Correlates of Mind Wandering with mobile EEG - BscThesis


**The app ```EEG-Droid``` is a modified version of an app that has been developed by students of the Institute of Cognitive Science at the University of Osnabrueck. The directory ```EEG-Droid``` in this repository is a clone of the original [```EEG-Droid``` repository by Adrián Rojas (adrocampos)](https://github.com/adrocampos/EEG-Droid) and contains the modified code of the app that was used for conducting an experiment on mind wandering. See section 2.1 of my thesis for an overview of the modifications of the original version of ```EEG-Droid``` and what new features have been added.**

## Abstract

Mind wandering is a phenomenon that illuminates the rich imaginative mental capacity of the human mind. Lived experience is not limited to external sources of stimulation but can also contain self-generated thought content. Studying the neural correlates of higher cognitive functions such as mind wandering in natural environments can be facilitated by mobile EEG. Therefore, the present study investigates to what extent higher cognitive functions can be studied using the *Traumschreiber*, a mobile EEG device developed at the University of Osnabrueck. Moreover, the present study utilizes a neurophenomenological approach by combining EEG with first person reports of mind wandering.

In order to compare the *Traumschreiber* to stationary research graded EEG systems, the present work constitutes a replication of a study by Braboszcz and Delorme (2011) who identified neural markers of low alertness during mind wandering. Participants performed a breath counting task and pressed a button whenever they realized their attention had drifted away from the task while they were exposed to a passive auditory oddball paradigm. The replication revealed significantly decreased alpha (9-11 Hz) and beta (15-30 Hz) frequency band power during mind wandering in comparison to breath focus state and thus provides further evidence for alterations in neural dynamics that are associated with mind wandering. However, the replication demonstrates that studying higher cognitive functions in a mobile setup using the *Traumschreiber* does not yield equivalent results compared to a stationary research graded EEG system.

Furthermore, the first person reports have highlighted that the phenomenology of mind wandering is of paramount importance in order to assess its costs and benefits. A differentiated account of mind wandering uncovers that not the frequency of mind wandering *per se* but the thought content and the context in which mind wandering occurs seem to determine whether mind wandering is beneficial or detrimental to mental health.
